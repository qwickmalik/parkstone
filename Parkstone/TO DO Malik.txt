 Notes FROM REVIEW 04 MARCH, 2015
---------------------------------


DONE 16.03.14 -Daily Maturity list report with following columns (Client Name, Amt on Maturity, Instruction, Action,Tenure[eg. 91 days,182 days])
DONE 16.03.14 -From above, must offer page/input for rolling over. This can be like a new investment page but will have limited fields like instructions and amount to rollover
-
Following Processes must follow a flow
-------------------------------------
--Payment

    so what u hv done is very fine
    we have to add a few more things
    first of all

DONE 16.03.14 when u click the process payments..we should have a list of requests for payments
DONE 16.03.14 then when every client is clicked..we are say presented with the ledger
DONE 16.03.14 the ledger will be the different entries..deposits by client,payments,terminations etc
    i will build a new table for that to mk it easy so dont worry..just providing the view will help
DONE 16.03.14 so with the ledger..we have the entries and at the bottom some kind of balance that is cash at hand which is all deposits - invested
    if the balance is less than client has requested then some investment has to be terminated
    so there has to be a button at the top or bottom somewhere
    *NB: Payment can only be made if client account has specified cash that is after termination or maturity
	 Also when cash is invested..it is subtracted from account available balance.


    so this is just a payment request
    so that is supposing a client payment is due
DONE 16.03.14    so it will have the ledger and some radios to reject,approve and default pending approval
    so when its approved, there will be a different page for listing all approved and unprocessed payments
    there they can have the daily maturity report
    t  his can be a page or a tab or submenu of the payments menu
    so from here they can make requests for payments which will lead to the process mentioned above
    

Termination
-------------------
    hope this is clear
    just trying to pick out the process better
ok so for terminations that will just start from manage investment or manage processed investments
    so he clicks terminate investment and a request is sent
    so on ther page listing termination requests, it can be approved or not
when approved it comes back to the list of approved terminations
when the approved termination requests are granted.
the user clicks on the investment terminates and has a button to pay some amount or all and reinvest the rest
dont know if this will better beserver with a wizard
to prevent replication of these processes
take terminate for instance
we can have an action link for for as a column on the listing of approved terminatoins..that will say pay and link to the a copy of current payment page we hvhave
then a button to reinvest after sucessful payment
we can look at doing same for the payment process
otherwise instead of copies we can just hv re-investment button on the payment receipt or summary page that allows to go to a reinvestment page to reinvest what is left
that will alow for a good workflow in the app. That is the trend in current softwares now so we will do well to follow
we can try and have flows in all our modules in our softwares from hence forth so more use of wizards or buttons/menu to help direct flow
let me know if u hv any questions pls

NOTES FROM REVIEW 24TH FEB.2015
--------------------------------------

--New Invesment
 Purchase price will be confirmed under Re-investments
*There should be a total amount input in top blue column which will be a total of amount client wants to spend on equities and/or fixed investments
*A label same blue column to display balances after part of total amount above is used

*Copy and use investment contract report under report to summarize a new investment instead of certificates(these are old school)
*MA, My bad..Currency submodule should rather be like the submodule in qwicktransfer(quick_dcash folder)
*he above means it will also have the exchange rates submodule in settings

--Manage Investments
*Following processes need approvals(Payment,Termination/Cancel,New Investors)..as in UCSL invoice approval

*add page in settings / input in payment terms or company setup page to set defaulting fee for early termination
*Cancel/terminate investment contract is subject to approval and fee 
*Workflow must be implemented for payments
*Payments can be made only if status is set to cancel or investment is due
*Approval must be made before payments are confirmed ..add status to show approval status
*Client statements must resemble client statements as in tech_specs folder
*Date on daily statements should reflect full date(day,month,year) Also it should show monthly aggregates not daily. Move to reports and replace with client statement
*Client Statements for equity investments must show following columns(Equity name,Purchase Price,Current Price,Gain/Loss)



--Re-investments(PROCESS INVESTMENTS)
*Allow for selection of multiple equities instead of one
*Payment & Termination Process(flow) as described above
*Administrator Pages for viewing pending terminations and payments as described in flow above
*Then Pages for accepted termination requests and payment requests

---Company Accounts

T0 D0
-------
Check Investment Statements especially for equities. 
    
--pls look at format for /mask.js for validation and implement in new investor pages

+ Please review new investor edit and details page for indv,joint,group and corp 
 Extras
+KWAKU: in the controller or somewhere you can write code that states that if the re-investor is NOT parkstone, then investment amount shouldnt deduct the amount from the pool
+Kwaku: Payment terms to be calculated in days
+Kwaku: Cron Job to process daily rates of fixed investments
+Malik: Report to list such additions by cron job in investment management

#########   BUGS    ###########
=============================================
Update Edit Investors to pick bank details etc.

19. Information on investment date and term should be added to investment certificates.
21.Please redefine Company accounts into receipts and payments. We should have a separate section to record any inflows, such as income (accrued or received), 
   and then a separate section for payments. Note that in accounting we should also be able to accrue expenses, not just cash receipts and payments. 
22. Update InvestorDetails to pull out all details from the db
