#########   BUGS    ###########
=============================================
Update Edit Investors to pick bank details etc.

19. Information on investment date and term should be added to investment certificates.
21.Please redefine Company accounts into receipts and payments. We should have a separate section to record any inflows, such as income (accrued or received), 
   and then a separate section for payments. Note that in accounting we should also be able to accrue expenses, not just cash receipts and payments. 
22. Update InvestorDetails to pull out all details from the db
