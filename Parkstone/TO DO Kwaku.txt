##########    BUGS    ##########
================================
+ Please check error under payment date on edit_payment.ctp
+ PRINT button for investment certificates not working
+ Pls take a look at newInvestment2_comp() and process_comp() for me.
 when an investment entry is processed, the investor id is lost and it throws an error. Same problem with group investment too. I've sorted out the views

---Parkstone Ideas-----


3. There will be another cron job to add daily interests to amounts. Will have accrued column and after outstanding due..different from
   total expected due or due on maturity date.,,Must consider if i have to add this to reinvestment deposit amounts.(Must know deposits accounts for moneys yet to be invested)
4. must have a table to record total cash owed clients at any moment..must condiser this being part of cron job calculations .
	An idea for this is to record totals of cash in investment..principal accrued and total...and add to them everytime they are actually reinvested..demands a new table
   


EQUITIES MANAGEMENT
=======================

+ Select an entry from that list to open a new view where details such as stock name, stock price, quantity to be purchased, commission (usually a % of sale value), etc will be captured.

+ The only problem i see with this approach is that it means all the money that a person intends for equity investment will have to be used to buy only one type of stock. 
This means in a case where the client leaves the decision as to which stocks to buy to Parkstone, they are constrained to buy only one type of stock. Otherwise, they will have to divide the money up into bits during the new_investment process so that the money will show up in bits during the equity management/re-investment process.
