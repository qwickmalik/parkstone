DONE - URGENT!!! Please check manage_equity_investment.ctp. Investment list not showing so can't proceed with further details of equity investment management
DONE - Please check new_investment2.ctp lines 404-431. Not displaying summaries for Equity
DONE - newInvestment2 for individual. When option of Fixed & Equity selected and one clicks process, for Fixed, totals for Equity get erased and vice-versa. Wasn't like this previously. However the system correctly generates both certificates. Also doesnt seem to clear the session so when i created a new investment (Fixed investment only) for another client, it gave both fixed and equity certificates with details of the previous client's equity and this was recorded in the db
Done - When new investment for Indiv is created, it doesnt add the investor_id to the investments table. hence one is unable to retrieve the equity or fixed investment under Manage Investments. 
DONE - Monies received from clients for equity investments, yet those monies have not been used to buy stocks on the stock exchange should show up in some sort of paginated list together with comments on which equities are to be bought with those monies plus a few client details
DONE - When time is due for the shares to be sold, the new share price will be entered and this should automatically calculate how much money is due to the client minus commission amount based on % entered earlier (see 2nd bullet above)
DONE - REDIRECT new cash deposit under reinvestment to certificate

EQUITIES MANAGEMENT
=======================

+ Select an entry from that list to open a new view where details such as stock name, stock price, quantity to be purchased, commission (usually a % of sale value), etc will be captured.

+ The only problem i see with this approach is that it means all the money that a person intends for equity investment will have to be used to buy only one type of stock. This means in a case where the client leaves the decision as to which stocks to buy to Parkstone, they are constrained to buy only one type of stock. Otherwise, they will have to divide the money up into bits during the new_investment process so that the money will show up in bits during the equity management/re-investment process.
