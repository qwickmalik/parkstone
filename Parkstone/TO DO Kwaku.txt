##########    BUGS    ##########
================================
+ Please check error under payment date on edit_payment.ctp
+ PRINT button for investment certificates not working
+ Pls take a look at newInvestment2_comp() and process_comp() for me.
 when an investment entry is processed, the investor id is lost and it throws an error. Same problem with group investment too. I've sorted out the views
New investor for group next button gives js error
---Parkstone Ideas-----


3. There will be another cron job to add daily interests to amounts. Will have accrued column and after outstanding due..different from
   total expected due or due on maturity date.,,Must consider if i have to add this to reinvestment deposit amounts.(Must know deposits accounts for moneys yet to be invested)
4. must have a table to record total cash owed clients at any moment..must condiser this being part of cron job calculations .
	An idea for this is to record totals of cash in investment..principal accrued and total...and add to them everytime they are actually reinvested..demands a new table
   


EQUITIES MANAGEMENT
=======================

+ Select an entry from that list to open a new view where details such as stock name, stock price, quantity to be purchased, commission (usually a % of sale value), etc will be captured.

+ The only problem i see with this approach is that it means all the money that a person intends for equity investment will have to be used to buy only one type of stock. 
This means in a case where the client leaves the decision as to which stocks to buy to Parkstone, they are constrained to buy only one type of stock. Otherwise, they will have to divide the money up into bits during the new_investment process so that the money will show up in bits during the equity management/re-investment process.

notes from Grace
------------------
Technically all cash on a client’s ledger is supposed to be invested. And so
 if a client wants some cash, we have to terminate an existing investment 
 to make money available to pay from the client’s ledger. However where there 
 are instructions from the client to hold a portion of their investment as cash,
 then we will first pay out of the cash and later terminate other running investments 
 to make up for the amount requested. This is a rare situation since clients will most
 likely keep their cash or money in an investment and for a period too.

 


On your second question, if the cash requested by a client is above what is in one investment 
then we will terminate the next running investment and top it up with the first investment and 
pay the client. For instance if a client has GHS 5,000.00 and GHS 2,000.00 running separately, 
and requests for GHS 6,000.00. We will terminate both investments and pay out the GHS 6,000.00 and
 reinvest the remaining amount, GHS 1,000.00.
 
---NOTES FROM ELSIE---
We will get income from the following sources:

1.       Management fees – a percentage of funds under management. This will be charged per each client, 
       and the percentage will be specific and agreed with client upfront.

      If this income source is used, it will be known upfront, and therefore, 
	  it may be useful if we have a box that we can check on management fee (yes/no). if yes, %.  If no, performance fee (as below).

2.       Performance fee – With this fee, there will be no specific fee charged. 
        Our fee will be based on performance – ie the difference between the return we 
		generate for theclient (the benchmark rate) and what we actually realise on making the investment. 
		The better we perform, the higher this fee could be. For eg. We agree a benchmark rate with client of 20% 
		(this will be the rate put in the fixed income space for computation of interest), and we go out and make an investment at 25%. 
		The difference of 5% becomes our income (performance fee).

3.       Mix of management fee and performance fee – we discussed this based on a portfolio of equity and fixed income. 
         We could have a base management fee (fixed and agreed), and then the performance fee additional, 
		 based on a certain benchmark return. If this benchmark is achieved, then we get an additional performance fee.  
		 With this option we may need to be able to select the options 1, 2 or 3 for fees.

 

       I would suggest a question to be ticked – fee?, then pop up box with management or performance or both. 
	   If management selected, then input rate.  if performance, indicate if 100% or alternative percentage. 
	   You will also need benchmark rate if the rate is not displayed on the page.

       I will suggest all sections with ‘rates’ be renamed ‘benchmark rate’.
--NOTES FRM REVIEW WITH PARKSTONE TEAM LED BY GRACE.(20TH MARCH,2015)--
	DONE - 1. (Kwaku) Management fee is for only equity. (Cron job to check basefee-duedate,add from base_fee to current accrued and add three months to current date.
  Will be taken from at beginning of investment order and subtracted from total amount being deposited.
  DONE - 2. (Kwaku)Performance fee is a benchmark rate same as interest for calculation of investment. This will not be subtracted initially or accrued like management but will be used to determine income of parkstone. The difference between this and performance of investment on the market will be parkstone's income.
DONE - 3. (Kwaku)Add years to Inv. Period in both investment and reinvestments and fund management.
DONE - 4. (Kwaku)Let ledger be a bank account like table that will have a unique row for every investor. There will be another table called
   ledger_transactions. This will list all credit and debit so main ledger has total cash,available cash,investment amt
   total debit and total credit.
DONE - 5. DONE -(Kwaku)Create ledger record when investor is created.
