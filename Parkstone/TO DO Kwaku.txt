
---NOTES FROM ELSIE---
We will get income from the following sources:

1.       Management fees – a percentage of funds under management. This will be charged per each client, 
       and the percentage will be specific and agreed with client upfront.

      If this income source is used, it will be known upfront, and therefore, 
	  it may be useful if we have a box that we can check on management fee (yes/no). if yes, %.  If no, performance fee (as below).

2.       Performance fee – With this fee, there will be no specific fee charged. 
        Our fee will be based on performance – ie the difference between the return we 
		generate for theclient (the benchmark rate) and what we actually realise on making the investment. 
		The better we perform, the higher this fee could be. For eg. We agree a benchmark rate with client of 20% 
		(this will be the rate put in the fixed income space for computation of interest), and we go out and make an investment at 25%. 
		The difference of 5% becomes our income (performance fee).

3.       Mix of management fee and performance fee – we discussed this based on a portfolio of equity and fixed income. 
         We could have a base management fee (fixed and agreed), and then the performance fee additional, 
		 based on a certain benchmark return. If this benchmark is achieved, then we get an additional performance fee.  
		 With this option we may need to be able to select the options 1, 2 or 3 for fees.

 

       I would suggest a question to be ticked – fee?, then pop up box with management or performance or both. 
	   If management selected, then input rate.  if performance, indicate if 100% or alternative percentage. 
	   You will also need benchmark rate if the rate is not displayed on the page.

       I will suggest all sections with ‘rates’ be renamed ‘benchmark rate’.

DONE -*Add "Semi Annual to Payment Schedule"
DONE -*Use investment term style in new-reinvestments(days,years,months)
*Total fees should not be compulsory and must be a percentage

 Purchase price will be confirmed under Re-investments

TO DO
----------

MOTTO--"Growth with stability"
#function
 #Function
 - cash_in/receive fixed investment cash function
 - cancel  equity function
 - cancel fixed  investment
 - pay reinvestor company
 ---AJAX UPLOAD OF INVESTOR IMAGES
+modify process_indv and process_corp investment function to accomodate new look joint,group and corp investment view (eg.new_investment2_joint.ctp)
+Convert amounts to primary currency selected in system setup
+KWAKU: in the controller or somewhere you can write code that states that if the re-investor is NOT parkstone, then investment amount shouldnt deduct the amount from the pool
+Kwaku: Payment terms to be calculated in days
+Kwaku: Cron Job to process daily rates of fixed investments
- Add group and Joint investor details
- If investment product type is equity, the rollover has to be different.also cross check current rollover function
- Instructions in Equity will be different
Schedule

--Windows version of cronjob is scheduler
---user wamp/php path and call script or install windows wget and run just like cronjob

##########    BUGS    ##########
================================
+ Please check error under payment date on edit_payment.ctp
+ PRINT button for investment certificates not working
+ Pls take a look at newInvestment2_comp() and process_comp() for me.
 when an investment entry is processed, the investor id is lost and it throws an error. Same problem with group investment too. I've sorted out the views

---Parkstone Ideas-----


3. There will be another cron job to add daily interests to amounts. Will have accrued column and after outstanding due..different from
   total expected due or due on maturity date.,,Must consider if i have to add this to reinvestment deposit amounts.(Must know deposits accounts for moneys yet to be invested)
4. must have a table to record total cash owed clients at any moment..must condiser this being part of cron job calculations .
	An idea for this is to record totals of cash in investment..principal accrued and total...and add to them everytime they are actually reinvested..demands a new table
   


EQUITIES MANAGEMENT
=======================

+ Select an entry from that list to open a new view where details such as stock name, stock price, quantity to be purchased, commission (usually a % of sale value), etc will be captured.

+ The only problem i see with this approach is that it means all the money that a person intends for equity investment will have to be used to buy only one type of stock. 
This means in a case where the client leaves the decision as to which stocks to buy to Parkstone, they are constrained to buy only one type of stock. Otherwise, they will have to divide the money up into bits during the new_investment process so that the money will show up in bits during the equity management/re-investment process.
