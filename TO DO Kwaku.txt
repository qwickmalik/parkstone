+KWAKU: in the controller or somewhere you can write code that states that if the re-investor is NOT parkstone, then investment amount shouldnt deduct the amount from the pool

- Add group and Joint investor details
- Instructions in Equity will be different

---Parkstone Ideas-----


3. There will be another cron job to add daily interests to amounts. Will have accrued column and after outstanding due..different from
   total expected due or due on maturity date.,,Must consider if i have to add this to reinvestment deposit amounts.(Must know deposits accounts for moneys yet to be invested)
4. must have a table to record total cash owed clients at any moment..must condiser this being part of cron job calculations .
	An idea for this is to record totals of cash in investment..principal accrued and total...and add to them everytime they are actually reinvested..demands a new table
   


EQUITIES MANAGEMENT
=======================

+ Select an entry from that list to open a new view where details such as stock name, stock price, quantity to be purchased, commission (usually a % of sale value), etc will be captured.

+ The only problem i see with this approach is that it means all the money that a person intends for equity investment will have to be used to buy only one type of stock. 
This means in a case where the client leaves the decision as to which stocks to buy to Parkstone, they are constrained to buy only one type of stock. Otherwise, they will have to divide the money up into bits during the new_investment process so that the money will show up in bits during the equity management/re-investment process.

notes from Grace
------------------
Technically all cash on a client’s ledger is supposed to be invested. And so
 if a client wants some cash, we have to terminate an existing investment 
 to make money available to pay from the client’s ledger. However where there 
 are instructions from the client to hold a portion of their investment as cash,
 then we will first pay out of the cash and later terminate other running investments 
 to make up for the amount requested. This is a rare situation since clients will most
 likely keep their cash or money in an investment and for a period too.

 


On your second question, if the cash requested by a client is above what is in one investment 
then we will terminate the next running investment and top it up with the first investment and 
pay the client. For instance if a client has GHS 5,000.00 and GHS 2,000.00 running separately, 
and requests for GHS 6,000.00. We will terminate both investments and pay out the GHS 6,000.00 and
 reinvest the remaining amount, GHS 1,000.00.
 
---NOTES FROM ELSIE---
We will get income from the following sources:

1.       Management fees – a percentage of funds under management. This will be charged per each client, 
       and the percentage will be specific and agreed with client upfront.

      If this income source is used, it will be known upfront, and therefore, 
	  it may be useful if we have a box that we can check on management fee (yes/no). if yes, %.  If no, performance fee (as below).

2.       Performance fee – With this fee, there will be no specific fee charged. 
        Our fee will be based on performance – ie the difference between the return we 
		generate for theclient (the benchmark rate) and what we actually realise on making the investment. 
		The better we perform, the higher this fee could be. For eg. We agree a benchmark rate with client of 20% 
		(this will be the rate put in the fixed income space for computation of interest), and we go out and make an investment at 25%. 
		The difference of 5% becomes our income (performance fee).

3.       Mix of management fee and performance fee – we discussed this based on a portfolio of equity and fixed income. 
         We could have a base management fee (fixed and agreed), and then the performance fee additional, 
		 based on a certain benchmark return. If this benchmark is achieved, then we get an additional performance fee.  
		 With this option we may need to be able to select the options 1, 2 or 3 for fees.

 

       I would suggest a question to be ticked – fee?, then pop up box with management or performance or both. 
	   If management selected, then input rate.  if performance, indicate if 100% or alternative percentage. 
	   You will also need benchmark rate if the rate is not displayed on the page.

       I will suggest all sections with ‘rates’ be renamed ‘benchmark rate’.
	   
NOTES FROM Sam
-------------------
I also think that we may need more than one investment pool for client funds in addition to Parkstone’s own funds which will obviously be separate. 
 So, I think you may have to make the possibility of creating/selecting an investment pool (more than one).
 You mentioned this possibility at our last discussion.
1.We agreed that all Clients will be put in a pool and charged a 6%p.a management fee. 
Once management fees are deducted from total income gained, the remaining income will be spread to all 
the clients according to weights that will be assigned to their amounts (based on their investment contributions) on a daily basis.
2.Income calculation will be done daily on investments we have made. Client statements will reflect the weighted average rate at 
each point in time (usually the end of the month).
3.Moneys must be pooled into one column both reinvestor fixed balance and returns
 when it is rolledover it must be subtracted from pool

DONE ----Client Statements	   
DONE==Management Fee Explanation==

Based on our recent meeting with our regulators, the 
treatment for our benchmark, performance and management fee has changed. We have agreed 
that we will charge a management fee of 6%,  Client’s interest will be calculated based  
on the benchmark rate assigned to them. Any additional return(rate) which, we call a performance fee will accrue to Parkstone Capital Ltd.
 
Hence, if we place a client’s investment at 32%, and we assign a benchmark rate of 25%, 6% will 
be management fee, the additional 1% will accrue to Parkstone Capital as a performance fee. Therefore 
when calculating our income, the Company will get the 6% management fee and 1% performance fee.

DONE - 3. (Kwaku)Add years to Inv. Period in both investment and reinvestments and fund management.
DONE - 4. (Kwaku)Let ledger be a bank account like table that will have a unique row for every investor. There will be another table called
