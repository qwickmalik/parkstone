The calculation of interest is done this way.

Supposing the client invested a GHS 1,000.00 at 80% for 91 days, this is how the interest calculation will be done: (GHS 1,000.00*0.80)*(91/365) = GHS 199.45.

To calculate the daily interest it will be (GHS 1,000.00*0.80)*(1/365)= GHS 2.19 for day 1 and so forth

In the event that the client needs his or her money after 50 days, the calculation will be: (GHS 1,000.00*0.75)*(50/365)=GHS 102.74.

Note that 0.75 is 0.80-0.05. (80%-5%).

 

Please note also that rate are quoted per annum, so the 80% is for the whole period and depending on clientâ€™s choice of tenure for
 the investment the number of days could be 91 days, 182 days or 365 days. So interest calculation can always be done at the beginning 
 of the investment or later when the client is terminating the investment.
