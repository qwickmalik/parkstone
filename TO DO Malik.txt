#########   BUGS    ###########
=============================================

21.Please redefine Company accounts into receipts and payments. We should have a separate section to record any inflows, such as income (accrued or received), 
   and then a separate section for payments. Note that in accounting we should also be able to accrue expenses, not just cash receipts and payments.

DONE *Copy and use investment contract report under report to summarize a new investment instead of certificates(these are old school)

DONE *The above means it will also have the exchange rates submodule in settings
DONE 22.03.15   7. (Malik)The investor contract should rather be a form of reciept.. current is fine.. but must rename something else. Contract will show for equity after purchase in reinvestments [ investment deposit receipt]

 Notes FROM REVIEW 04 MARCH, 2015
---------------------------------
DONE 16.03.15 -Daily Maturity list report with following columns (Client Name, Amt on Maturity, Instruction, Action,Tenure[eg. 91 days,182 days])
DONE 16.03.15 -From above, must offer page/input for rolling over. This can be like a new investment page but will have limited fields like instructions and amount to rollover
-
Following Processes must follow a flow
-------------------------------------
--Payment
DONE 16.03.15 when u click the process payments..we should have a list of requests for payments
DONE 16.03.15 then when every client is clicked..we are say presented with the ledger
DONE 16.03.15 the ledger will be the different entries..deposits by client,payments,terminations etc
    i will build a new table for that to mk it easy so dont worry..just providing the view will help
DONE 16.03.15 so with the ledger..we have the entries and at the bottom some kind of balance that is cash at hand which is all deposits - invested
    if the balance is less than client has requested then some investment has to be terminated
    so there has to be a button at the top or bottom somewhere
    *NB: Payment can only be made if client account has specified cash that is after termination or maturity
	 Also when cash is invested..it is subtracted from account available balance.


    so this is just a payment request
    so that is supposing a client payment is due
DONE 16.03.15    so it will have the ledger and some radios to reject,approve and default pending approval
    so when its approved, there will be a different page for listing all approved and unprocessed payments
    there they can have the daily maturity report
    t  his can be a page or a tab or submenu of the payments menu
    so from here they can make requests for payments which will lead to the process mentioned above
