NOTES FROM REVIEW 24TH FEB.2015
--------------------------------------

--New Invesment
DONE 10.03.15 *Allow for selection of multiple equities instead of one

DONE 10.03.15 *Add currency sub-module from settings in Suame POS
DONE by Kwaku *Change purchase price inputs to min and max inputs(this is an order page and so client will want purchase if market price stays in given max - min range)
 Purchase price will be confirmed under Re-investments
DONE by Kwaku *Input must be provided for management fee[as disccused above in elsie's notes] 


---TO DO

*There should be a total amount input in top blue column which will be a total of amount client wants to spend on equities and/or fixed investments

*Use investment contract report under report to summarize a new investment instead of certificates(these are old school)
*MA, My bad..Currency submodule should rather be like the submodule in qwicktransfer(quick_dcash folder)
*he above means it will also have the exchange rates submodule in settings

--Manage Investments
*Following processes need approvals(Payment,Termination/Cancel,New Investors)..as in UCSL invoice approval

*add page in settings / input in payment terms or company setup page to set defaulting fee for early termination
*Cancel/terminate investment contract is subject to approval and fee 
*Workflow must be implemented for payments
*Payments can be made only if status is set to cancel or investment is due
*Approval must be made before payments are confirmed ..add status to show approval status
*Client statements must resemble client statements as in tech_specs folder
*Date on daily statements should reflect full date(day,month,year) Also it should show monthly aggregates not daily. Move to reports and replace with client statement
*Client Statements for equity investments must show following columns(Equity name,Purchase Price,Current Price,Gain/Loss)



--Re-investments(PROCESS INVESTMENTS)
DONE by Kwaku *Change name "Reinvestments to Manage Investments[this conflicts with manage investments under investment module..do we propose different name?]"
DONE by Kwaku *Divide Reinvestments into two.
DONE by Kwaku 1.Fund Management [Re-investor submodules..and cash deposit submodules..The two divisions might have to share destination 
DONE by Kwaku    submodule..also consider moving destination submodules to settings]
DONE by Kwaku  2. Manage Investments[should this be Investment backend or a better phrase becos of the conflict?]

---Company Accounts
*If using Asset Management, it might have to be used for handle assets in terms of client funds




T0 D0
-------
Check Investment Statements especially for equities.

 Extras
+KWAKU: in the controller or somewhere you can write code that states that if the re-investor is NOT parkstone, then investment amount shouldnt deduct the amount from the pool
+Kwaku: Payment terms to be calculated in days
+Kwaku: Cron Job to process daily rates of fixed investments

#########   BUGS    ###########
=============================================
Update Edit Investors to pick bank details etc.

19. Information on investment date and term should be added to investment certificates.
21.Please redefine Company accounts into receipts and payments. We should have a separate section to record any inflows, such as income (accrued or received), 
   and then a separate section for payments. Note that in accounting we should also be able to accrue expenses, not just cash receipts and payments. 
22. Update InvestorDetails to pull out all details from the db
