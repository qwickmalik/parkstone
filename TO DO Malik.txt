NOTES FROM REVIEW 24TH FEB.2015
--------------------------------------
---NOTES FROM ELSIE---
We will get income from the following sources:

1.       Management fees – a percentage of funds under management. This will be charged per each client, 
       and the percentage will be specific and agreed with client upfront.

      If this income source is used, it will be known upfront, and therefore, 
	  it may be useful if we have a box that we can check on management fee (yes/no). if yes, %.  If no, performance fee (as below).

2.       Performance fee – With this fee, there will be no specific fee charged. 
        Our fee will be based on performance – ie the difference between the return we 
		generate for theclient (the benchmark rate) and what we actually realise on making the investment. 
		The better we perform, the higher this fee could be. For eg. We agree a benchmark rate with client of 20% 
		(this will be the rate put in the fixed income space for computation of interest), and we go out and make an investment at 25%. 
		The difference of 5% becomes our income (performance fee).

3.       Mix of management fee and performance fee – we discussed this based on a portfolio of equity and fixed income. 
         We could have a base management fee (fixed and agreed), and then the performance fee additional, 
		 based on a certain benchmark return. If this benchmark is achieved, then we get an additional performance fee.  
		 With this option we may need to be able to select the options 1, 2 or 3 for fees.

 

       I would suggest a question to be ticked – fee?, then pop up box with management or performance or both. 
	   If management selected, then input rate.  if performance, indicate if 100% or alternative percentage. 
	   You will also need benchmark rate if the rate is not displayed on the page.

       I will suggest all sections with ‘rates’ be renamed ‘benchmark rate’.

 

I am not sure I understand the question on profit. It will really be income less all expenses, as is normally the case.

I hope its not the determination of the income which is causing some confusion.


--New Invesment
*Allow for selection of multiple equities instead of one
*Use investment contract report under report to summarize a new investment instead of certificates(these are old school)
*Add currency sub-module from settings in Suame POS
*Change purchase price inputs to min and max inputs(this is an order page and so client will want purchase if market price stays in given max - min range)
 Purchase price will be confirmed under Re-investments
*Input must be provided for management fee[as disccused above in elsie's notes] 
*There should be a total amount input in top blue column which will be a total of amount client wants to spend on equities and/or fixed investments


--Manage Investments
*Following processes need approvals(Payment,Termination/Cancel,New Investors)..as in UCSL invoice approval

*add page in settings / input in payment terms or company setup page to set defaulting fee for early termination
*Cancel/terminate investment contract is subject to approval and fee 
*Workflow must be implemented for payments
*Payments can be made only if status is set to cancel or investment is due
*Approval must be made before payments are confirmed ..add status to show approval status
*Client statements must resemble client statemtns elsie has given(to kwaku)
*Date on daily statements should reflect full date(day,month,year) Also it should show monthly aggregates not daily. Move to reports and replace with client statement
*Client Statements for equity investments must show following columns(Equity name,Purchase Price,Current Price,Gain/Loss)



--Re-investments
*Change name "Reinvestments to Manage Investments[this conflicts with manage investments under investment module..do we propose different name?]"
*Divide Reinvestments into two.
 1.Fund Management [Re-investor submodules..and cash deposit submodules..The two divisions might have to share destination 
   submodule..also consider moving destination submodules to settings]
 2. Manage Investments[should this be Investment backend or a better phrase becos of the conflict?]

---Company Accounts
*If using Asset Management, it might have to be used for handle assets in terms of client funds

#########   BUGS    ###########
=============================================
Update Edit Investors to pick bank details etc.

19. Information on investment date and term should be added to investment certificates.
21.Please redefine Company accounts into receipts and payments. We should have a separate section to record any inflows, such as income (accrued or received), 
   and then a separate section for payments. Note that in accounting we should also be able to accrue expenses, not just cash receipts and payments. 
22. Update InvestorDetails to pull out all details from the db
